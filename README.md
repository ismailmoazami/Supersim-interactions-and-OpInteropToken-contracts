# Interop Interactions and Interoperable token
## Summary 
- I developed a script for interactions with chains of Supersim like transferring tokens seamlessly between local OP chains. 
- Developed also a sample token that is SuperchainERC20 bridgable called OpInteropToken.
- When you are working with Supersim and Interop, always consider that you must deploy tokens at the same address in all chains. You can use CREATE2 for this purpose.
